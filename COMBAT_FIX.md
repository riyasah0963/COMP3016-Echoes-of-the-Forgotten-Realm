# COMBAT FIX INSTRUCTIONS

## Problem:
The combat system doesn't recognize full words like "attack", "use item", "flee"

## Quick Fix:
You need to type just the NUMBERS in combat:

### ✅ **WORKING COMBAT COMMANDS:**
- Type `1` for Attack
- Type `2` for Use item  
- Type `3` for Try to flee

### ❌ **DON'T TYPE THESE IN COMBAT:**
- ~~attack~~ (use `1` instead)
- ~~use item~~ (use `2` instead)  
- ~~flee~~ (use `3` instead)

## 🎮 **CORRECT GAMEPLAY:**

```
> attack
